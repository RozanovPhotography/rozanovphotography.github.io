							<p>Michael has been a joy to work with! He is a mathematician, computer scientist (which I discovered recently, of course), photographer and my lovely friend. He offered to create a homepage for me and I really appreciate all the effort he had put into it. I asked him to do quite a lot of corrections and tweaks and he had always been very patient and helpful.
							<br />Thank you!</p>

							<p>Michael is a mathematician who is excellent in programming. He not only created a fabulous website for me, but also offered loads of inventive ideas on personalizing my website. When it comes to technical issues, Michael is responsible and patient. He is always willing to conduct multiple experiments so that he could provide the most ideal solution possible.<br />
							   He is also an avid photographer. His Instagram page will amaze you. Do check it out 🙂<br />
							   Moreover, Michael is open and eager to learn things in other cultures, which is a quality that I view highly of.</p>

							<p>Michael possesses aptitude for Physics and is able to explain concepts to others in an entertaining but insightful way. He is a polite and engaging young man who works well both independently and in groups. He is capable at taking a leading role in group work as well as sitting back and considering other people's viewpoints. Michael has a real passion for thinking like a Physicist and is a wonderful contributor to lessons with his ability to write innovative questions. His strengths lie in his resilience at solving complex, multistep problems and this is true in various Physics areas from Circular Motion to Electricity. Michael is currently working hard and I expect great results from him in the future. He is clearly the most focussed Physics student in his class!</p>

							<p>Michael is an extremely intelligent, insightful and hardworking student who has demonstrated fantastic subject knowledge as well as critique of A-Level Economics. This has been reflected in his consistently excellent grades throughout the year. He approaches all the numerical questions with confidence, combining his natural numeracy skills, skill in Mathematics and understanding of Economics to make light work of challenging questions. Michael will without a doubt excel at university where his natural aptitudes in dissecting complex topics as well as his meticulous focus on getting the details right will prepare him well for further education.</p>

							<p>Michael is an incredibly talented mathematician who has excelled in his A Level Maths. Michael is very thorough in seeking to have a deep understanding of all new concepts. He asks impressive and insightful questions which reveal his skill in the subject. I am most impressed by Michael's attention to detail which means he rarely makes mistakes in the A Level Maths syllabus. Michael also eagerly tackles problems which are outside the scope of A Level Maths. He has developed an excellent conceptual understanding of calculus and consistently demonstrates efficient methods of solving problems. Michael is always highly enthusiastic and applies himself, he has a keen interest in mathematics. This year, he achieved a Silver certificate in the senior UKMT Maths challenge. Michael is very keen to seize opportunities to further his mathematical knowledge and understanding. He has attended Saturday morning masterclasses by the Royal Institution of maths.</p>

							<p>Michael is an excellent mathematician, who in the past has been very successful. He is focussed in lessons and can successfully work through some very tough problems. Michael thinks deeply about mathematics and is keen to know the why as well as how, a sign of a great mathematician. His classwork and homework are to a very high standard. He also asks very inquisitive questions that show an impressive interest in the subject.</p>

							<p>Since beginning Business Studies back in September, Michael set his bar for success. He knew what he wanted to achieve and would make sure that there were no barriers to deter his progress. He has been consistent in the level of work submitted and is always open to feedback given, with English not being his first language, he has worked tremendously hard to ensure that he fully understand the key concepts so that je may achieve A* he desires. Michael has worked hard to exceed his target grade this year and it has been my pleasure to witness his attempts. I only hope that his natural talent in Business sees him go on to create amazing development in the future.</p>

							<p>Determined and thoughtful, Michael has slowly but surely developed his Spanish from zero to A* standard course work. His hard work and willingness to please have enabled Michael o make this remarkable amount of progress. It has never been anything less than an absolute privilege to teach Michael despite his quiet and humble nature in class. He is perhaps slightly overwhelmed by the animated mix of year 9s to 11s. Michael undeniably had a difficult challenge to ace when arriving from Russia. Faced with the requirement of a minimum of a С in English, Michael accepted the challenge of his third language with will power and motivation. I wish him all the best in the approaching exams and can openly say it has been a huge honour working with him this year.</p>
